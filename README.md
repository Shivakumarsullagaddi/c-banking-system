# c-banking-system
A case study of a simple banking system using C programming. This code simulates a basic banking system where a user can perform common operations such as creating an account, checking account balances, depositing money, withdrawing money, and logging out.

The code includes the following features:

1. Create a new account: The user can create a new account by entering their name, age, Aadhaar number, and initial deposit amount.
The system checks if the Aadhaar number already exists and prompts the user to create a 4-digit password.


2. Check account balance: The user can check their account balance by entering their Customer ID and password. The system displays the account balance if the credentials match.


3. Deposit money: The user can deposit money by entering the amount. The system adds the amount to the account balance.


4. Withdraw money: The user can withdraw money by entering the amount. The system checks if the account balance is sufficient and deducts the amount from the account balance.


5. Logout: The user can log out of the system by pressing (ctrl+c) or entering 5.

The code uses various data types, operators, and input/output functions to simulate the banking system. The code also includes error checking to ensure that the user enters valid input.

The code uses loops and nested if-else statements to control the flow of the program and switch-case statements to handle user input.
