# c-banking-system
A case study of a simple banking system using C programming. This code simulates a basic banking system where a user can perform common operations such as creating an account, checking account balances, depositing money, withdrawing money, and logging out.

The code includes the following features:

Create a new account: The user can create a new account by entering their name, age, Aadhaar number, and initial deposit amount. The system checks if the Aadhaar number already exists and prompts the user to create a 4-digit password.
Check account balance: The user can check their account balance by entering their Customer ID and password. The system displays the account balance if the credentials match.
Deposit money: The user can deposit money by entering the amount. The system adds the amount to the account balance.
Withdraw money: The user can withdraw money by entering the amount. The system checks if the account balance is sufficient and deducts the amount from the account balance.
Logout: The user can log out of the system by pressing (ctrl+c) or entering 5.
The code uses various data types, operators, and input/output functions to simulate the banking system. The code also includes error checking to ensure that the user enters valid input. The code uses loops and nested if-else statements to control the flow of the program and switch-case statements to handle user input.

Note: This code is for educational purposes only and not for production use. The code is not secure and does not include any encryption or security measures. It is recommended to use a secure and tested banking system for real-world applications.
